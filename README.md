# Recursion | Practice Project

Two recursive functions: a Fibonacci sequence calculator, and a merge sort algorithm.
Usually, there's a live demo available. Since it's just three basic functions, there's not much point in building a Github Page for it.

## About

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) curriculum. It is the sixth project required for completion of the JavaScript Course [6/12].

These were the project requirements:

- Using iteration, write a function fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.
- Using recursion, write another function fibsRec which solves the same problem recursively.
- Build a function mergeSort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.

## Learning Outcomes

Learn the basics of recursion, how to implement it in JavaScript and also how to implement a merge sort algorithm.
